  # High Quality README Generator

  ## This README Generator allows the user to have a more-efficient experience in developing a professional-looking README for their GitHub Repository through the use of node, npm inquirer, and the command line in the intergrated terminal. 

  - My motivation for designing this generator, while yes it was originally designed as a homework assignment, it has now evolved into a tool that I will be able to use for the duration of this class and for years to come (with necessary updates being made to improve it of course). 
  - I built this generator as it was prompted as a homework assignment for class, however, it does serve its purpose in a real life application. Furthermore, I was able to use this developing experience as one that built skill in JavaScript, use of NPM, and learning how to import and export packages and functions. 
  - While developing README's are not the end of the world, having to program one entirely from scatch can be a timely task and can feel boring, redundant, and unnecessary. Truth of the matter, it frankly is. That is not to say that README's are without purpose in the coding world, thus the need for a proffesional generator was born. 
  - I was able to develop skills in the command line, skills in installing and using npm packages, and learning how to import and export functions and packages into different JavaScript files, regardless of location/destination. 

  
  
  ## Installation
  The installation for this is quite simple, but there are some steps. 
  - Step 1: Clone this repository in your IDE on your local machine
  - Step 2: Install the needed NPM Packages in the command line
      - inquirer ("npm i inquirer")
      - fs ("npm i fs" should already be installed)
  - Step 3: Make sure Node.JS is installed on your local machine
  - Step 4: You have installed!

  ## Usage
  Using this is much easier than the installation process, simply just open the intergrated terminal from the "index.js" file and run the command "node index.js" and let the terminal do the rest of the work!
